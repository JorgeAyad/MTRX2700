## Overview

The overall assignment code is stored in 5 section folders for each of the sections. Some of the subsections sections are carried over from previous subsections due to constructive nature of some of the sections.

The code is broken down and modularised wherever possible for ease of usage and clarity for debugging and troubleshooting which are separated under file names like "delay.s". This allows a better legibility of the order process of multi function code where there are many functions integrated within the main file. 

Modularised code for each section are listed under each of the different sections for ease of accessibility. 

NOTE: Definitions and setup files like "definitions.s" and "initialise.s" are taken from the code examples, as they follow a very similar or same process as any other setup file due to the same model of board used. 

## How to run the code

In each of the subsection folders, the SRC folder contains the files required to run the main code with the respective include files that need to be also used. To run the program, all that is required is to place the files under the same SRC directory and ensure that the required functions are uncommented or set correctly in the variables section wherever applicable. 

## How to test and debug.

In the ssections of the codes, there are various ways of debugging and testing code like using physical indicators like LED indicators and PuTTy, or by checking the memory addresses of the stored data. This is more prominent in Section 2 and 4 where LED indicators utilised while the Memory checking is more suited to Sections 1 and 4
