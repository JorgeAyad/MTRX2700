 * @brief     STM32F303VCTx device vector table for GCC toolchain.
 *            This module performs:
 *                - Set the initial SP
 *                - Set the initial PC == Reset_Handler,
 *                - Set the vector table entries with the exceptions ISR address
 *                - Branches to main in the C library (which eventually
 *                  calls main()).
